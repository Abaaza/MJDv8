# Export Format Preservation - Fix Summary

## Issue

Export results were creating basic Excel files instead of preserving the original Excel format and structure.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Original file cleanup**: The `PriceMatchingService.cleanup()` method was deleting original input files after processing
2. **Wrong table name**: Export endpoint was using incorrect table name (`matching_jobs` instead of `ai_matching_jobs`)
3. **Limited file recovery**: Export endpoint couldn't properly download original files from blob storage
4. **Service inconsistency**: Both `CohereMatchingService` and `LocalPriceMatchingService` were using basic Excel generation instead of format-preserving `ExcelExportService`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Preserve Original Files During Cleanup

**File**: `server/services/PriceMatchingService.js`

- Modified `cleanup()` method to NOT delete original input files (files containing `job-` prefix)
- These files are now preserved for later use in export format preservation

### 2. Fix Database Table Names

**File**: `server/routes/priceMatching.js`

- Fixed incorrect table references from `matching_jobs` to `ai_matching_jobs`
- Ensures proper job data retrieval for export

### 3. Enhanced Export File Recovery

**File**: `server/routes/priceMatching.js`

- Added detailed logging for debugging export issues
- Enhanced original file search logic with multiple fallback strategies:
  1. Download from blob storage if available
  2. Check local original file path
  3. Search temp directory with broader patterns
- Added error handling for blob storage failures

### 4. Updated Services to Use Format Preservation

**Files**:

- `server/services/CohereMatchingService.js`
- `server/services/LocalPriceMatchingService.js`

Both services now:

- Use `ExcelExportService.exportWithOriginalFormat()` when original file is available
- Fall back to basic export only when original file cannot be found
- Attempt to download original file from blob storage if needed

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Run the Export Test Script

```bash
cd server
node test-export-format.js
```

This will:

- Check if original files are preserved
- Test blob storage download functionality
- Verify ExcelExportService is working correctly

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

#### Local Testing:

1. Upload an Excel file for matching
2. Wait for job to complete
3. Export results - should now preserve original format
4. Verify exported file has:
   - Original structure and formatting
   - New columns for matched data
   - Same layout as original file

#### Vercel Testing:

1. Deploy updated code to Vercel
2. Upload Excel file for matching
3. Export results
4. Check logs for detailed export process information

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:

```
üìÑ Creating basic Excel export (original file not available)...
üì§ Basic Excel export for 523 results
```

### After Fix:

```
üîç Looking for original file for job: xxx
‚úÖ Original file downloaded from blob and saved to: /tmp/export-original-xxx.xlsx
üìÑ Creating Excel export with preserved formatting...
‚úÖ Format-preserved Excel export completed: /output/matched-xxx.xlsx
```

## Debugging

If export still fails to preserve format, check:

1. **Original file availability**:

   ```bash
   # Check if files are preserved after processing
   ls server/temp/job-*
   ```

2. **Blob storage access**:

   - Verify `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is set correctly
   - Check `input_file_blob_key` is saved in database

3. **Export logs**:
   - Look for detailed export logging in console
   - Check for any error messages during blob download

## File Structure After Fix

```
server/temp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ job-[jobId]-[filename].xlsx        # ‚úÖ Now preserved
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ export-original-[jobId]-[file].xlsx # Downloaded for export
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ other-temp-files.xlsx              # Cleaned up as before

server/output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ matched-[jobId]-[filename].xlsx    # ‚úÖ Now with original format
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ basic-export-[jobId]-[file].xlsx   # Fallback only
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Original input files are preserved after processing
- [ ] Export endpoint can download from blob storage
- [ ] CohereMatchingService uses format preservation
- [ ] LocalPriceMatchingService uses format preservation
- [ ] Export falls back gracefully when original file unavailable
- [ ] Detailed logging shows export process steps
- [ ] Table names are correct throughout codebase

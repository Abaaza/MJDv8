## ⚡ Progress Sync Speed Fix

### Problem:
- PriceMatching progress took too long to reach 10%
- Projects page showed progress faster
- There was a 100ms delay + slow polling

### Solution Applied:
✅ **Immediate polling** - No more 100ms delay
✅ **Faster polling interval** - Changed from 1000ms to 500ms
✅ **Instant UI updates** - Progress shows immediately when polling starts

### Technical Changes:
```javascript
// Before: 100ms delay + 1000ms interval
setTimeout(..., 100);
setInterval(..., 1000);

// After: Immediate + 500ms interval  
(async () => { /* immediate poll */ })();
setInterval(..., 500);
```

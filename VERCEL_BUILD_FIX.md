# Fix Vercel Build Error

## The Issue

Vercel couldn't find the frontend build output because the configuration wasn't set up correctly for a monorepo structure.

## Quick Fix

I've updated the configuration files. Now you need to:

### 1. Commit and push the changes:

```bash
git add vercel.json package.json
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build configuration"
git push
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel

- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" on your project
- Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## What I Fixed

### Updated `vercel.json`:

- Changed to build from root package.json
- Set correct output directory to `client/dist`
- Simplified the build configuration

### Updated root `package.json`:

- Added proper install script that installs both client and server dependencies
- Added build script that builds the frontend
- Removed conflicting build commands

## Alternative: Simple Vercel Configuration

If the build still fails, you can try this simpler approach:

### Option 1: Use Vercel's Auto-Detection

Delete `vercel.json` completely and let Vercel auto-detect:

```bash
rm vercel.json
git add -A
git commit -m "Let Vercel auto-detect configuration"
git push
```

Then in Vercel dashboard:

- Go to Project Settings
- Set Root Directory to `client`
- Set Build Command to `npm run build`
- Set Output Directory to `dist`

### Option 2: Deploy Frontend and Backend Separately

**Frontend (in Vercel):**

1. Create new Vercel project
2. Set Root Directory to `client`
3. Deploy normally

**Backend (use one of these):**

- Railway
- Render
- AWS Lambda (manual)

## The Root Cause

The issue was that Vercel was trying to build from the root directory but couldn't find the frontend build output. With a monorepo structure (client + server), we need to tell Vercel:

1. Where to find the build scripts
2. Where the output will be located
3. How to route requests between frontend and backend

## Test After Fix

Once deployed successfully, test:

- Frontend: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- Backend: `https://your-app.vercel.app/health`

Your app should work perfectly with both frontend and backend on the same domain!

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard
```typescript
// Before: Basic stats only
{ title: "Total Clients", value: "123" }

// After: Rich analytics with trends
{
  title: "Total Clients",
  value: "123",
  trend: "+5.2%",
  trendUp: true,
  description: "Active clients"
}
```

### 2. Robust Excel Parsing
```javascript
// Before: Basic XLSX reading
const workbook = XLSX.readFile(filePath)

// After: Enhanced with error handling
const workbook = XLSX.readFile(filePath, {
  cellDates: true,
  cellNF: false,
  cellText: false,
  sheetStubs: false,
  bookVBA: false,
  password: ''
})
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// New: Comprehensive performance tracking
const memoryInfo = useMemoryMonitor('ComponentName')
const { debounce, throttle } = useOptimizedEventHandlers()
const { addTask } = useBackgroundTasks()
```
